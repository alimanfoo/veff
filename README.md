veff - Variant effect prediction
================================

I use Pablo Cingolani's excellent
[SnpEff](https://github.com/pcingola/SnpEff) tool a lot, however have
recently suspected a bug in the amino acid change predictions and have
also wanted programmatic access from Python so have developed `veff`
as a partial re-implementation of the SnpEff functionality.

This is work in progress.
